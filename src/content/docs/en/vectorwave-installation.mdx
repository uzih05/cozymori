order: 11
category: VectorWave
---

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10 — 3.13
- **Docker** (to run the Weaviate vector database)
- (Optional) **OpenAI API Key** for AI auto-documentation, high-performance embedding, and self-healing

## 1. Start Weaviate

VectorWave uses [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) as its vector database. Start it with Docker:

### Quick Start (Single Container)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name weaviate \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 50051:50051 \
  cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:latest
```

> For production deployments, consider [Weaviate Cloud (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) — a fully managed Weaviate instance.

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  weaviate:
    command:
    - --host
    - 0.0.0.0
    - --port
    - '8080'
    - --scheme
    - http
    image: semitechnologies/weaviate:1.26.1
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    - 50051:50051
    restart: on-failure:0
    environment:
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: 'none'
      ENABLE_MODULES: 'text2vec-openai,generative-openai'
      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 2. Install VectorWave

```bash
pip install vectorwave
```

## 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Vectorizer (choose one)
VECTORWAVE_VECTORIZER=huggingface    # Free, runs locally (default)
# VECTORWAVE_VECTORIZER=openai_client  # Higher quality, requires API key

# OpenAI (required for openai_client vectorizer, self-healing, and RAG)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Weaviate connection (optional, defaults shown)
WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Vectorizer Options

| Vectorizer | Cost | Quality | Speed | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `huggingface` | Free | Good | Local CPU/GPU | No API key needed |
| `openai_client` | $0.0001/1K tokens | Excellent | API call | Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

## 4. Initialize Database

Before first use, initialize the Weaviate collections:

```python
from vectorwave import initialize_database

initialize_database()
```

This creates four collections in Weaviate:

- `VectorWaveFunctions` — Stores function metadata (source code, descriptions, module paths)
- `VectorWaveExecutions` — Stores execution logs (inputs, outputs, errors, embeddings)
- `VectorWaveGoldenDataset` — Stores verified high-quality executions for cache priority and drift detection
- `VectorWaveTokenUsage` — Tracks LLM token usage for cost monitoring

### Schema Migration

If you add new custom properties via `.weaviate_properties` or upgrade VectorWave, update the schema:

```python
from vectorwave import update_database_schema

update_database_schema()
```

This adds new properties to existing collections without data loss. Existing properties are never modified.

## 5. Verify Installation

```python
from vectorwave import vectorize, initialize_database

initialize_database()

@vectorize(auto=True)
def hello(name: str):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

result = hello("World")
print(result)  # "Hello, World!"
```

If this runs without errors, VectorWave is ready. Check your Weaviate console at `http://localhost:8080/v1/meta` to verify the connection.

## Troubleshooting

### Weaviate connection refused

```
ConnectionError: Connection to Weaviate failed
```

Make sure Docker is running and Weaviate is accessible:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/meta
```

### Module not found

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vectorwave'
```

Ensure you're using the correct Python environment:

```bash
pip show vectorwave
```
