## Bento Grid Dashboard

The main dashboard uses a **Bento grid layout** — a responsive, card-based arrangement that shows all key metrics at a glance.

### KPI Cards

Four top-level KPI cards:

| Card | Metric | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Total Calls** | Count | Total function executions tracked |
| **Avg Latency** | Milliseconds | Average execution time across all functions |
| **Error Rate** | Percentage | Ratio of failed to total executions |
| **Cache Hit %** | Percentage | Semantic cache hit rate |

### Execution Timeline

Real-time chart showing function executions over time:

- Stacked area chart with success/error/cached breakdown
- Configurable time range (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Hover for detailed breakdowns per timestamp
- Auto-refreshes at configurable intervals

### Error Distribution

Pie/donut chart of error types:

- Grouped by error code or exception type
- Click to filter execution list by error type
- Color-coded severity levels

### Widget Customization

Drag-and-drop widgets to customize your dashboard layout. Resize widgets and save layouts per user.

## Trace Waterfall

The trace waterfall visualizes distributed traces created by `@vectorize` and `@trace_span`.

### Reading the Waterfall

```
pipeline()                    ████████████████████████░░░░░ 450ms

└── format_result()           ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░   20ms
```

- **Horizontal bars** represent span duration
- **Nesting** shows parent-child relationships
- **Colors** indicate status:
  - Green = success
  - Red = error
  - Blue = cache hit
  - Gray = in progress

### Span Details

Click any span to see:

- Function name and module path
- Input parameters (if `capture_inputs=True`)
- Return value (if `capture_return_value=True`)
- Error details and stack trace (if failed)
- Duration breakdown
- Cache hit status
- Weaviate UUID for raw data access

### Filtering Traces

- Filter by function name, status, duration range
- Sort by timestamp, duration, or error count
- Search traces by trace ID

## AI Healer

The AI Healer provides a visual interface for [VectorWave's self-healing](/docs/vectorwave-healing) capabilities.

### Error Browser

Browse all recent errors with:

- Error type and message
- Affected function and module
- Timestamp and frequency
- Stack trace preview

### Single Diagnosis

1. Select an error from the list
2. Click "Diagnose" to run the AI Healer
3. View the diagnosis:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Suggested code fix with diff highlighting
   - Confidence score
4. Click "Create PR" to open a GitHub Pull Request

### Batch Diagnosis

1. Select multiple errors (or "Select All")
2. Click "Batch Diagnose"
3. Review all diagnoses in a summary view
4. Create PRs for approved fixes

### Diagnosis History

View past diagnoses and their outcomes:

- Which fixes were merged
- Which were rejected
- Success rate over time

## Replay Testing UI

Visual interface for [VectorWave's replay testing](/docs/vectorwave-testing).

### Running a Replay

1. Select a function from the sidebar
2. Choose test entries:
   - **Golden Only** — Only verified Golden Dataset entries
   - **All** — All stored executions
3. Select comparison mode:
   - **Exact Match** — Character-by-character comparison
   - **Semantic** — Embedding similarity with configurable threshold
4. Click "Run Replay"

### Results View

- **Summary** — Pass/fail counts, success rate
- **Detail View** — Side-by-side comparison of expected vs actual output
- **Similarity Score** — Cosine similarity for semantic comparisons
- **Diff View** — Character-level diff for exact match failures

### Golden Dataset Management

- Browse all Golden Dataset entries per function
- Promote new executions to Golden status
- Remove outdated Golden entries
- View AI-recommended candidates for Golden promotion

## Semantic Search

Full-text and vector search across all VectorWave data.

### Search Interface

- Natural language search bar at the top
- Real-time results as you type
- Filter by:
  - Function name
  - Team
  - Status (success/error/cached)
  - Date range
  - Error code

### Search Results

Results include:

- **Functions** — Matching function definitions with source code preview
- **Executions** — Matching execution logs with input/output previews
- **Errors** — Matching error logs with stack traces
- **Traces** — Matching trace chains with waterfall preview

### RAG Q&A

Click "Ask AI" to use [RAG-powered Q&A](/docs/vectorwave-search):

- Type a question in natural language
- Get contextual answers based on your codebase
- Sources are linked for verification

## Multi-Language UI

VectorSurfer supports three languages:

| Language | Code | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| English | `en` | Full |
| Japanese | `ja` | Full |
| Korean | `ko` | Full |

Switch languages from the settings menu. All UI elements, labels, and messages are translated.
