## Dashboard

The main dashboard uses a customizable widget grid layout. Enter **Edit Mode** to add, remove, resize, and reorder widgets.

### Available Widgets

| Widget | Size | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **KPI Overview** | S / M / L | Five KPI cards: Total Executions, Success Rate, Errors, Cache Hit Rate, Avg Duration. Each shows a sparkline and trend indicator vs. previous period. |
| **Execution Timeline** | M / L | Bar/line chart showing executions over time with three series: Success (green), Error (red), Cache Hit (blue). Bucket size adapts to the selected time range. |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | S | Circular gauge showing cache hit percentage with hit/total count. |
| **Error Rate** | S | Large percentage display with color coding: blue (under 5%), orange (5–10%), red (over 10%). |
| **Token Usage** | S / M | Total token count with a donut chart breakdown by category. |
| **Function Distribution** | M / L | Horizontal bar chart of the top 10 functions by execution count. |
| **Recent Errors** | M / L | Scrollable list of latest errors showing function name, error code, message, and relative time. |
| **System Status** | S | Weaviate connection status (connected/disconnected), registered function count, and last-checked timestamp. |
| **Suggest Overview** | M / L | Priority-badged list of top 5 AI suggestions (critical/high/medium/low). Links to the full Suggest page. |

### Widget Sizes

- **S** (Small) — 1 column
- **M** (Medium) — 2 columns
- **L** (Large) — 4 columns, full width

### Dashboard Controls

- **Time Range** — Select from presets (15m, 30m, 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d) or set a custom date-time range. All time-based widgets update together.
- **Chart Fill** — Choose between Line, Gradient, or Solid fill styles for charts.
- **Refresh** — Manually refresh all widget data.
- **Edit Mode** — Toggle to add/remove/resize widgets. Each widget shows S/M/L size buttons and a remove button.

## Ask AI

Natural language Q&A over your VectorWave data using RAG.

### How to Use

1. Navigate to **Ask AI** in the sidebar
2. Select a **function scope** — choose "All Functions" or a specific function to narrow the context
3. Type your question in the text area (e.g., "Why is my embed function failing?")
4. Click **Ask**

The AI retrieves relevant function data, execution logs, and error context from Weaviate, then generates an answer.

### Plan Limits

| Plan | Daily AI Calls | Saved Response Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | 5 per day | Locked after 24 hours |
| **Pro** | Unlimited | Full access to all history |

Free plan users see a usage bar showing today's remaining calls. When the daily limit is reached, the Ask button is disabled with a message: "Daily limit reached. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited access."

### Saving and Bookmarking

Responses from Ask AI are automatically saved to your **AI History**. You can bookmark important responses by clicking the bookmark icon on any result.

## AI History (Saved Responses)

Browse and manage all AI responses from Ask AI and Healer.

### Filtering

- **Source filter** — Show all, Ask AI only, or Healer only
- **Bookmarked** — Toggle to show only bookmarked responses
- **Search** — Full-text search across questions and answers

### Response Cards

Each card shows the source icon, question preview, source type badge, function name (if scoped), timestamp, and bookmark status. Click to expand and view the full answer.

### Actions

- **Bookmark / Unbookmark** — Toggle bookmark status on any response
- **Delete** — Remove a response permanently (with confirmation)

### Free Plan Limitation

On the Free plan, responses older than 24 hours are locked (shown with reduced opacity and a lock icon). Upgrade to Pro for unlimited access to your full AI history.

## Trace Waterfall

The trace waterfall visualizes distributed call chains as interactive diagrams.

### Reading the Waterfall

```
pipeline()                    ████████████████████████░░░░░ 450ms
├── embed()                   ██████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  180ms
├── search()                  ░░░░░░░░░░████████░░░░░░░░░░  150ms
└── format_result()           ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░   20ms
```

- **Horizontal bars** represent span duration
- **Nesting** shows parent-child relationships
- **Colors** indicate status:
  - Green = success
  - Red = error
  - Blue = cache hit
  - Gray = in progress

### Span Details

Click any span to see:

- Function name and module path
- Input parameters and return value
- Error details and stack trace (if failed)
- Duration breakdown and cache hit status

### Filtering Traces

- Filter by function name, status, or duration range
- Sort by timestamp, duration, or error count
- Search traces by trace ID

## AI Healer

The AI Healer diagnoses errors and suggests code fixes. Requires an OpenAI API key.

### Single Diagnosis

1. Select a function from the dropdown
2. Adjust the **lookback** slider to set the time window
3. Click **Diagnose & Heal**
4. View the diagnosis: root cause analysis and suggested fix (syntax-highlighted Python code)
5. Copy the fix or **Save** the diagnosis to AI History (Pro only)

### Batch Diagnosis

1. Switch to **Batch Mode**
2. Select multiple functions using checkboxes
3. Click **Batch Diagnose (N)**
4. Review all diagnoses in a summary view

### Time Range

Choose a lookback window: 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, or All.

## Replay Testing

Visual regression testing for AI functions.

### Running a Replay

1. Select a function from the sidebar
2. Choose test entries:
   - **Golden Only** — Verified Golden Dataset entries
   - **All** — All stored executions
3. Select comparison mode:
   - **Exact Match** — Character-by-character comparison
   - **Semantic** — Embedding similarity with configurable threshold
4. Click **Run Replay**

### Results View

- **Summary** — Pass/fail counts, success rate
- **Detail View** — Side-by-side comparison of expected vs actual output
- **Similarity Score** — Cosine similarity for semantic comparisons
- **Diff View** — Character-level diff for exact match failures

### Golden Dataset Management

- Browse all Golden Dataset entries per function
- Promote new executions to Golden status
- Remove outdated entries
- View AI-recommended candidates for promotion

## Semantic Search

Full-text and vector search across all your AI function data.

### Search Interface

- Natural language search bar at the top

### Search Results

Results include:

- **Functions** — Matching function definitions
- **Executions** — Matching execution logs with input/output previews
- **Errors** — Matching error logs with stack traces
