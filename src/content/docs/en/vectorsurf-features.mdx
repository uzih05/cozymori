## Dashboard

The main dashboard uses a responsive card-based layout that shows all key metrics at a glance.

### KPI Cards

Four top-level KPI cards display real-time metrics:

| Card | Metric | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Total Calls** | Count | Total function executions tracked |
| **Avg Latency** | Milliseconds | Average execution time across all functions |
| **Error Rate** | Percentage | Ratio of failed to total executions |
| **Cache Hit %** | Percentage | Semantic cache hit rate |

### Execution Timeline

A real-time chart showing function executions over time:

- Stacked area chart with success/error/cached breakdown
- Configurable time range (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Hover for detailed breakdowns per timestamp
- Auto-refreshes at configurable intervals

### Error Distribution

Donut chart showing error types:

- Grouped by error code or exception type
- Click to filter execution list by error type
- Color-coded severity levels

### Widget Customization

Drag-and-drop widgets to customize your dashboard layout. Resize widgets and save layouts per user.

## Trace Waterfall

The trace waterfall visualizes distributed call chains as interactive diagrams.

### Reading the Waterfall

```

```

- **Horizontal bars** represent span duration
- **Nesting** shows parent-child relationships
- **Colors** indicate status:
  - Green = success
  - Red = error
  - Blue = cache hit
  - Gray = in progress

### Span Details

Click any span to see:

- Function name and module path
- Input parameters and return value
- Error details and stack trace (if failed)
- Duration breakdown and cache hit status

### Filtering Traces

- Filter by function name, status, or duration range
- Sort by timestamp, duration, or error count
- Search traces by trace ID

## AI Healer

The AI Healer diagnoses errors and suggests code fixes automatically.

### Error Browser

Browse all recent errors with:

- Error type and message
- Affected function and module
- Timestamp and frequency
- Stack trace preview

### Single Diagnosis

1. Select an error from the list
2. Click **Diagnose** to run the AI Healer
3. View the diagnosis:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Suggested code fix with diff highlighting
   - Confidence score
4. Click **Create PR** to open a GitHub Pull Request

### Batch Diagnosis

1. Select multiple errors (or **Select All**)
2. Click **Batch Diagnose**
3. Review all diagnoses in a summary view
4. Create PRs for approved fixes

### Diagnosis History

View past diagnoses and their outcomes — which fixes were merged, which were rejected, and success rate over time.

## Replay Testing

Visual regression testing for AI functions.

### Running a Replay

1. Select a function from the sidebar
2. Choose test entries:
   - **Golden Only** — Verified Golden Dataset entries
   - **All** — All stored executions
3. Select comparison mode:
   - **Exact Match** — Character-by-character comparison
   - **Semantic** — Embedding similarity with configurable threshold
4. Click **Run Replay**

### Results View

- **Summary** — Pass/fail counts, success rate
- **Detail View** — Side-by-side comparison of expected vs actual output
- **Similarity Score** — Cosine similarity for semantic comparisons
- **Diff View** — Character-level diff for exact match failures

### Golden Dataset Management

- Browse all Golden Dataset entries per function
- Promote new executions to Golden status
- Remove outdated entries
- View AI-recommended candidates for promotion

## Semantic Search

Full-text and vector search across all your AI function data.

### Search Interface

- Natural language search bar at the top
- Real-time results as you type
- Filter by function name, status, date range, or error code

### Search Results

Results include:

- **Functions** — Matching function definitions
- **Executions** — Matching execution logs with input/output previews
- **Errors** — Matching error logs with stack traces
- **Traces** — Matching trace chains with waterfall preview

### RAG Q&A

Click **Ask AI** for natural language Q&A:

- Type a question about your codebase
- Get contextual answers based on your data
- Sources are linked for verification

## Multi-Language UI

VectorSurfer supports three languages:

| Language | Code |
|---|---|
| English | `en` |
| Japanese | `ja` |
| Korean | `ko` |

Switch languages from the settings menu. All UI elements, labels, and messages are translated.
