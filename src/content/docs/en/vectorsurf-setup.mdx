## Prerequisites

Before using VectorSurfer, you need:

- **VectorWave** installed and configured in your Python project ([Installation](/docs/vectorwave-installation))
- A running **Weaviate** instance with VectorWave data
- A modern web browser

## Step 1: Sign Up

Visit the VectorSurfer dashboard and create an account:

**[Open VectorSurfer →](https://vectorsurfer.com)**

1. Click **Sign Up**
2. Enter your **email** and **password**
3. Optionally add a **display name**
4. Click **Sign Up** to create your account

Already have an account? Click **Log In** and enter your email and password.

## Step 2: Create a Weaviate Connection

After signing in, you'll be directed to the **Projects** page. This is where you connect VectorSurfer to your Weaviate instance.

1. Click **Create Connection**
2. Choose a **connection type**:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Self Hosted** | Your own Weaviate instance (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) |
| **WCS Cloud** | Managed instance on [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) |

3. Fill in the connection details:

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Default | A label for this connection (e.g., "Production") |
| **Host** | `localhost` | Weaviate server hostname or IP |
| **HTTP Port** | `8080` | Weaviate REST API port |
| **gRPC Port** | `50051` | Weaviate gRPC port |
| **API Key** | — | Authentication key (required for WCS Cloud, optional for self-hosted) |

4. Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity
5. If the test passes, click **Create** to save the connection
6. Click **Activate** on the connection card to make it active

> **First time?** A quick-start guide appears at the bottom of the Projects page. Click **Start Guide** for a step-by-step walkthrough covering Weaviate setup and VectorWave installation.

## Step 3: Set Up VectorWave

If you haven't already, install VectorWave and start logging function executions:

```bash
pip install vectorwave
```

```python
from vectorwave import vectorize, initialize_database

initialize_database()

@vectorize(auto=True, capture_return_value=True)
def your_function(prompt: str):
    # Your AI function logic
    return result
```

Once functions are decorated with `@vectorize`, every execution is automatically stored in Weaviate. VectorSurfer reads from the same Weaviate instance and displays your data immediately.

See the [VectorWave Quick Start](/docs/quickstart) for detailed setup instructions.

## Step 4: Configure AI Features (Optional)

AI-powered features like **Ask AI**, **Healer diagnosis**, and **semantic search** require an OpenAI API key.

### Global API Key

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the sidebar)
2. Open the **AI Settings** tab
3. Enter your OpenAI API key (`sk-...`)
4. Click **Save**

This key is used for all AI features across all connections.

### Per-Connection API Key

You can also set a separate OpenAI key for a specific connection:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Connections** tab
2. Click the key icon next to a connection
3. Enter the API key and save

Connections with an API key configured show an **AI Ready** badge on their card.

> AI features are optional — the dashboard works for monitoring, tracing, and execution browsing without an OpenAI key.

## Step 5: Explore the Dashboard

Once your connection is active and VectorWave has recorded executions, the dashboard displays your data:

- **KPI Cards** — Total executions, success rate, error rate, cache hit rate, average duration
- **Execution Timeline** — Function activity over time
- **Recent Errors** — Latest errors at a glance
- **System Status** — Weaviate connection health

The dashboard is fully customizable — click the **Edit** button to add, remove, resize, and reorder widgets. See [Usage Guide](/docs/vectorsurf-features) for details on all available widgets.
