## Prerequisites

Before using VectorSurfer, you need:

- **VectorWave** installed and configured in your Python project
- A running **Weaviate** instance with VectorWave data
- A modern web browser

## Step 1: Set Up VectorWave

If you haven't already, install VectorWave and start logging function executions:

```bash
pip install vectorwave
```

```python
from vectorwave import vectorize, initialize_database

initialize_database()

@vectorize(auto=True, capture_return_value=True)
def your_function(prompt: str):
    # Your AI function logic
    return result
```

Once functions are decorated with `@vectorize`, every execution is automatically stored in Weaviate.

See the [VectorWave Quick Start](/docs/quickstart) for detailed setup instructions.

## Step 2: Open the Dashboard

Visit the VectorSurfer dashboard:

**[Open Dashboard →](https://vectorsurfer.com)**

VectorSurfer reads from the same Weaviate instance that VectorWave writes to. Once connected, all your function data appears automatically.

## Step 3: Explore Your Data

When VectorWave has recorded executions, the dashboard displays:

- **KPI Cards** with real-time metrics
- **Execution Timeline** showing function activity over time
- **Function List** in the sidebar for filtering

If the dashboard shows no data, make sure VectorWave has logged at least one function execution.

## Connecting to Weaviate

VectorSurfer connects to the Weaviate instance configured in VectorWave. Ensure your Weaviate instance is accessible from the dashboard.

For local development, Weaviate typically runs on `http://localhost:8080`. For production, use your cloud Weaviate endpoint.

## Optional: AI Healer Setup

To enable AI-powered error diagnosis and automatic GitHub PRs:

- Configure an **OpenAI API key** in the dashboard settings
- Connect a **GitHub repository** for auto-PR creation

These features are optional — the dashboard works for monitoring and tracing without them.
