## What is Semantic Drift?

Over time, the inputs your AI functions receive may change — new topics, different phrasing patterns, or entirely new use cases. **Semantic Drift** occurs when new inputs move far from your validated "Golden Dataset."

This matters because:

- Cached results may become irrelevant
- Model performance may degrade on unfamiliar inputs
- Errors may increase for edge cases you haven't tested

VectorWave's **Drift Radar** monitors this in real-time.

## How Drift Detection Works

```
New Input → Embedding → Distance from Golden Centroid
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴──────────┐
                    │                     │
              Distance < 0.25       Distance ≥ 0.25
              (Within bounds)       (DRIFT DETECTED)
                    │                     │
                    ▼                     ▼
              Normal execution      Webhook Alert
                                   (Discord/Slack)
```

1. VectorWave maintains a **centroid** (average vector) of all Golden Dataset entries for each function
2. When a new input arrives, it calculates the **cosine distance** from the centroid
3. If the distance exceeds the threshold (default: 0.25), a drift alert is triggered

## Golden Dataset Management

The Golden Dataset is your collection of verified, high-quality executions. These serve as the baseline for drift detection.

### Promoting Executions to Golden

```python
from vectorwave import VectorWaveDatasetManager

dm = VectorWaveDatasetManager()

# Promote a verified execution to Golden status
dm.register_as_golden(
    log_uuid="abc-123",
    note="Verified by QA team",
    tags=["v2", "production"],
)
```

### Auto-Recommending Golden Candidates

VectorWave can suggest executions that are good candidates for Golden status:

```python
# Get recommendations based on success rate and diversity
candidates = dm.recommend_candidates(
    function_name="generate_response",
    limit=5,
)

for candidate in candidates:
    print(f"UUID: {candidate['uuid']}")
    print(f"Input: {candidate['input_preview']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {candidate['confidence_score']}")
    print("---")
```

### Listing Golden Entries

```python
# Get all Golden entries for a function
golden = dm.get_golden_dataset(
    function_name="generate_response",
)

print(f"Golden dataset size: {len(golden)}")
```

## Webhook Alerts

When drift is detected, VectorWave sends a real-time alert via webhook.

### Discord Integration

```python
from vectorwave import configure_alerts

configure_alerts(
    webhook_url="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
    drift_threshold=0.25,  # Default
)
```

The Discord embed includes:

- Function name and module path
- Error code (if applicable)
- Trace ID for debugging
- Captured attributes (inputs, tags)
- Full stack trace (for error-triggered drifts)
- Distance value from Golden centroid

### Custom Webhook

```python
configure_alerts(
    webhook_url="https://your-api.com/alerts",
    drift_threshold=0.30,
    format="json",  # Raw JSON payload instead of Discord embed
)
```

### Alert Payload

```json
{
  "type": "drift_detected",
  "function_name": "generate_response",
  "module_path": "app.ai.generator",
  "distance": 0.34,
  "threshold": 0.25,
  "input_preview": "How do I mine bitcoin...",
  "trace_id": "abc-123",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Threshold Tuning

| Threshold | Sensitivity | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `0.15` | Very sensitive | Safety-critical applications |
| `0.25` | Default | General production monitoring |
| `0.35` | Lenient | Exploratory / creative applications |
| `0.50` | Very lenient | Wide-scope functions |

### Per-Function Thresholds

```python
@vectorize(
    auto=True,
    drift_threshold=0.20,  # Stricter than default
)
def safety_critical_function(query: str):
    ...

@vectorize(
    auto=True,
    drift_threshold=0.40,  # More lenient
)
def creative_function(query: str):
    ...
```
