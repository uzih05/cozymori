## What is the Golden Dataset?

The **Golden Dataset** is a curated collection of verified, high-quality function executions. When you promote an execution to "Golden" status, it becomes a trusted reference used across multiple VectorWave features.

`initialize_database()` creates the `VectorWaveGoldenDataset` collection automatically.

## Why Use Golden Data?

Golden data is used in three key areas:

### 1. Semantic Cache Priority

When semantic caching is enabled, VectorWave searches the Golden Dataset **first** before checking standard execution logs. This ensures:

- Deterministic results for known input patterns
- Higher quality cached responses (manually verified)
- Consistent behavior across deployments

See [Semantic Caching](/docs/vectorwave-caching) for details on the 2-tier cache lookup.

### 2. Drift Detection Baseline

The [Drift Radar](/docs/vectorwave-drift) uses a **KNN-based** approach — when a new input arrives, it's compared against the K-nearest neighbors from past successful executions. The average distance to these neighbors determines whether drift has occurred.

More historical data = more reliable drift detection = fewer false positives.

### 3. Replay Testing Baseline

[Replay testing](/docs/vectorwave-testing) uses Golden entries as expected outputs. When you run `VectorWaveReplayer`, Golden data is tested first (priority), then standard execution logs.

## Managing Golden Data

### Promoting Executions

```python
from vectorwave import VectorWaveDatasetManager

dm = VectorWaveDatasetManager()

# Promote a verified execution to Golden status
dm.register_as_golden(
    log_uuid="abc-123",
    note="Verified by QA team",
    tags=["v2", "production"],
)
```

The original execution's vector and properties are copied to the Golden collection.

### Auto-Recommending Candidates

VectorWave analyzes the vector distribution of your existing Golden data and recommends new candidates:

```python
candidates = dm.recommend_candidates(
    function_name="generate_response",
    limit=5,
)

for c in candidates:
    print(f"UUID: {c['uuid']}, Type: {c['type']}, Distance: {c['distance']:.3f}")
```

Candidates are classified as:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **STEADY** | Close to existing Golden centroid — reinforces known patterns |
| **DISCOVERY** | Farther from centroid — represents new valid patterns |

> **VectorSurfer**: Golden Dataset management is built into the [VectorSurfer dashboard](/vectorsurf) — browse, promote, and manage golden entries visually with AI-recommended candidates.
