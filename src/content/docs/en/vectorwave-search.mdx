## Overview

VectorWave stores your function source code, execution logs, and traces in Weaviate as vectorized data. **RAG Search** lets you query this data with natural language.

```python
from vectorwave import search_and_answer

answer = search_and_answer("Which functions handle user authentication?")
print(answer)
# "Based on your codebase, authentication is handled by:
#  1. app.auth.verify_token() - JWT token verification
#  2. app.auth.login() - User login with password hashing
#  3. app.middleware.auth_guard() - Route protection middleware"
```

## Code Search

### Search Functions

Find functions by natural language description:

```python
from vectorwave import search_functions

results = search_functions(
    query="error handling and retry logic",
    limit=5,
)

for func in results:
    print(f"{func['full_name']} — {func['description']}")
    print(f"  Module: {func['module_path']}")
    print(f"  Score: {func['similarity']:.2f}")
```

### Search Executions

Find specific execution logs using filter-based search:

```python
from vectorwave import search_executions

results = search_executions(
    limit=10,
    filters={
        "status": "ERROR",
        "function_name__like": "payment",
    },
    sort_by="timestamp_utc",
    sort_ascending=False,
)

for log in results:
    print(f"{log['function_name']} — {log['timestamp_utc']}")
    print(f"  Error: {log['error_message']}")
    print(f"  Trace: {log['trace_id']}")
```

### Search Errors

Find errors by semantic similarity to a natural language description:

```python
from vectorwave import search_errors_by_message

results = search_errors_by_message(
    query="timeout connecting to external API",
    limit=10,
    filters={"function_name": "generate_response"},
)

for error in results:
    print(f"{error['function_name']} — {error['error_code']}")
    print(f"  Message: {error['error_message']}")
    print(f"  Trace: {error['trace_id']}")
```

Unlike `search_executions` (filter-based), `search_errors_by_message` uses **vector search** to find semantically similar error messages — useful when you don't know the exact error text.

## RAG Q&A

### Code-Level Q&A

Ask questions about your codebase and get contextual answers:

```python
from vectorwave import search_and_answer

# Ask about function behavior
answer = search_and_answer(
    "How does the semantic caching work in our generate_response function?"
)

# Ask about error patterns
answer = search_and_answer(
    "What are the most common errors in the payment module this week?"
)

# Ask about architecture
answer = search_and_answer(
    "What functions are called when a user submits a form?"
)
```

### Trace Log Analysis

Analyze distributed traces with natural language:

```python
from vectorwave import analyze_trace_log

analysis = analyze_trace_log(
    trace_id="abc-123",
    question="Why did this trace take so long?",
)

print(analysis)
# "The trace took 4.2s total. The bottleneck was the
#  embed() function (3.8s), which called the OpenAI
#  API. Consider using semantic caching to avoid
#  redundant embedding calls."
```

## Hybrid Search

VectorWave supports **hybrid search** — combining vector similarity with keyword filtering:

```python
from vectorwave import search_functions_hybrid

results = search_functions_hybrid(
    query="database connection pooling",
    limit=10,
    alpha=0.5,   # 0.0 = pure keyword (BM25), 1.0 = pure vector
    filters={"team": "backend"},  # Optional filters
)
```

This uses Weaviate's built-in hybrid search, combining BM25 keyword matching with vector similarity for more precise results.

> **VectorSurfer**: All search capabilities are available through the [VectorSurfer dashboard](/vectorsurf) with a visual interface — natural language search bar, filters by function/team/status/date, click-through to execution details, and trace waterfall visualization.
