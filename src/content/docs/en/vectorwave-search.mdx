## Overview

VectorWave stores your function source code, execution logs, and traces in Weaviate as vectorized data. **RAG Search** lets you query this data with natural language.

```python
from vectorwave import search_and_answer

answer = search_and_answer("Which functions handle user authentication?")
print(answer)
# "Based on your codebase, authentication is handled by:
#  1. app.auth.verify_token() - JWT token verification
#  2. app.auth.login() - User login with password hashing
#  3. app.middleware.auth_guard() - Route protection middleware"
```

## Code Search

### Search Functions

Find functions by natural language description:

```python
from vectorwave import search_functions

results = search_functions(
    query="error handling and retry logic",
    limit=5,
)

for func in results:
    print(f"{func['full_name']} — {func['description']}")
    print(f"  Module: {func['module_path']}")
    print(f"  Score: {func['similarity']:.2f}")
```

### Search Executions

Find specific execution logs:

```python
from vectorwave import search_executions

results = search_executions(
    query="timeout errors in payment processing",
    limit=10,
    filters={
        "status": "error",
        "team": "payments",
    },
)

for log in results:
    print(f"{log['function_name']} — {log['timestamp']}")
    print(f"  Error: {log['error_message']}")
    print(f"  Trace: {log['trace_id']}")
```

## RAG Q&A

### Code-Level Q&A

Ask questions about your codebase and get contextual answers:

```python
from vectorwave import search_and_answer

# Ask about function behavior
answer = search_and_answer(
    "How does the semantic caching work in our generate_response function?"
)

# Ask about error patterns
answer = search_and_answer(
    "What are the most common errors in the payment module this week?"
)

# Ask about architecture
answer = search_and_answer(
    "What functions are called when a user submits a form?"
)
```

### Trace Log Analysis

Analyze distributed traces with natural language:

```python
from vectorwave import analyze_trace_log

analysis = analyze_trace_log(
    trace_id="abc-123",
    question="Why did this trace take so long?",
)

print(analysis)
# "The trace took 4.2s total. The bottleneck was the
#  embed() function (3.8s), which called the OpenAI
#  API. Consider using semantic caching to avoid
#  redundant embedding calls."
```

## Hybrid Search

VectorWave supports **hybrid search** — combining vector similarity with keyword filtering:

```python
from vectorwave import hybrid_search

results = hybrid_search(
    query="database connection pooling",
    keyword_filter="PostgreSQL",  # Must contain this keyword
    limit=10,
)
```

This uses Weaviate's built-in hybrid search, combining BM25 keyword matching with vector similarity for more precise results.
