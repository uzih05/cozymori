## What is VectorSurfer?

**VectorSurfer** is a full-stack observability dashboard for monitoring all your [VectorWave](/docs/vectorwave-overview) data in real-time. Built with **Next.js 16 + FastAPI**, it provides visual tools for everything VectorWave captures.

## Key Features

### Bento Grid Dashboard

Drag-and-drop responsive dashboard with widgets:

- **KPI Cards** — Total calls, success rate, average latency, cache hit rate
- **Execution Timeline** — Real-time chart of function executions over time
- **Error Distribution** — Breakdown of error types and frequencies
- **Drift Monitor** — Visual distance from Golden Dataset centroid

### Trace Waterfall

Visualize distributed traces as an interactive waterfall diagram:

- See the full call chain of `@vectorize` + `@trace_span` functions
- Identify bottlenecks and slow spans at a glance
- Click into any span for detailed execution data
- Color-coded by status (success, error, cached)

### AI Healer

GPT-4 powered error diagnosis with a visual interface:

- Browse recent errors with full context
- One-click diagnosis via [VectorWaveHealer](/docs/vectorwave-healing)
- View generated code fixes with diff highlighting
- Create GitHub PRs directly from the dashboard
- Batch healing for multiple errors at once

### Replay Testing

Visual replay testing UI:

- Select functions and Golden Dataset entries
- Run replays with real-time progress
- Compare expected vs actual outputs side-by-side
- Supports both exact match and [semantic comparison](/docs/vectorwave-testing)

### Semantic Search

Natural language search across all VectorWave data:

- Search functions, execution logs, and errors
- Hybrid search (vector similarity + keyword filtering)
- Click-through to full execution details
- Integrated with [RAG Q&A](/docs/vectorwave-search)

### Multi-Language UI

English, Japanese, and Korean UI out of the box — built for global teams.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) |
| **Database** | Weaviate (shared with VectorWave) |
| **AI** | OpenAI GPT-4 (for AI Healer and RAG) |
| **Charts** | Recharts / D3 |
| **i18n** | next-intl |

## Relationship to VectorWave

VectorSurfer is the **companion dashboard** for VectorWave. It reads from the same Weaviate instance that VectorWave writes to:

```
Your App + @vectorize → Weaviate ← VectorSurfer Dashboard
```

You don't need VectorSurfer to use VectorWave — the SDK works standalone. But VectorSurfer makes it much easier to:

- Monitor function health in real-time
- Diagnose errors visually
- Manage Golden Datasets
- Run replay tests

## Alternatives

| Dashboard | Type | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **VectorSurfer** | Full-stack (Next.js + FastAPI) | Production, teams |
| **[VectorSurferSTL](/docs/vectorsurferstl)** | Lightweight (Streamlit) | Quick setup, local dev |
