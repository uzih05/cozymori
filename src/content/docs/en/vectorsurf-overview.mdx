## What is VectorSurfer?

**VectorSurfer** is a real-time AI observability dashboard. It connects to your [VectorWave](/docs/vectorwave-overview) data and provides visual tools for monitoring, tracing, and healing AI function calls.

```
Your App + @vectorize → Weaviate ← VectorSurfer Dashboard
```

VectorWave captures function executions, and VectorSurfer turns that data into actionable insights — all in one unified interface.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Dashboard

A responsive card-based dashboard that shows all key metrics at a glance:

- **KPI Cards** — Total calls, success rate, average latency, cache hit rate
- **Execution Timeline** — Function executions over time with success/error/cache breakdown
- **Error Distribution** — Error types and frequencies
- **Drift Monitor** — Visual distance from Golden Dataset centroid

### Trace Waterfall

Visualize distributed traces as interactive waterfall diagrams:

- See the full call chain of decorated functions
- Identify bottlenecks and slow spans instantly
- Click into any span for detailed execution data
- Color-coded by status (success, error, cached)

### AI Healer

GPT-4 powered error diagnosis with a visual interface:

- Browse recent errors with full context
- One-click root cause analysis
- View generated code fixes with diff highlighting
- Create GitHub PRs directly from the dashboard
- Batch healing for multiple errors at once

### Replay Testing

Visual regression testing for AI functions:

- Select functions and Golden Dataset entries
- Run replays with real-time progress
- Compare expected vs actual outputs side-by-side
- Supports both exact match and semantic comparison

### Semantic Search

Natural language search across all your AI function data:

- Search functions, execution logs, and errors
- Hybrid search (vector similarity + keyword filtering)
- RAG-powered Q&A for exploring your codebase

### Multi-Language UI

English, Japanese, and Korean UI out of the box — built for global teams.

## How It Works

VectorSurfer reads from the same Weaviate instance that VectorWave writes to. There is no extra instrumentation needed — just use `@vectorize` in your Python code, and VectorSurfer shows everything.

VectorWave is not required to use VectorSurfer, but the SDK is what generates the data the dashboard displays.

## Alternatives

| Dashboard | Best For |
|---|---|
| **VectorSurfer** | Production, teams, full-featured |
| **[VectorSurferSTL](/docs/vectorsurferstl)** | Quick setup, local dev, Python-only |
