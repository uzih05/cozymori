## What is VectorSurfer?

**VectorSurfer** is a real-time AI observability dashboard. It connects to your [VectorWave](/docs/vectorwave-overview) data and provides visual tools for monitoring, tracing, and healing AI function calls.

```
Your App + @vectorize → Weaviate ← VectorSurfer Dashboard
```

VectorWave captures function executions, and VectorSurfer turns that data into actionable insights — all in one unified interface.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Dashboard

A responsive widget grid dashboard that shows all key metrics at a glance:

- **KPI Cards** — Total calls, success rate, errors, cache hit rate, average duration
- **Execution Timeline** — Function executions over time with success/error/cache breakdown
- **Token Usage** — LLM token consumption by category
- **System Status** — Weaviate connection status and registered function count

### Trace Waterfall

Visualize distributed traces as interactive waterfall diagrams:

- See the full call chain of decorated functions
- Identify bottlenecks and slow spans instantly
- Click into any span for detailed execution data
- Color-coded by status (success, error, cached)

### AI Healer

GPT-4 powered error diagnosis with a visual interface:

- Browse recent errors with full context
- One-click root cause analysis
- View generated code fixes with diff highlighting
- Create GitHub PRs directly from the dashboard
- Batch healing for multiple errors at once

### Replay Testing

Visual regression testing for AI functions:

- Select functions and Golden Dataset entries
- Run replays with real-time progress
- Compare expected vs actual outputs side-by-side
- Supports both exact match and semantic comparison

### Ask AI

RAG-powered natural language Q&A over your VectorWave data:

- Ask questions about your functions, errors, and execution patterns
- AI retrieves relevant context from Weaviate and generates answers
- Responses are automatically saved to AI History

### AI History (Saved Responses)

Browse and manage all AI-generated responses:

- Filter by source (Ask AI / Healer), bookmark status, or keyword
- Bookmark important responses for quick access
- Free plan: 5 AI calls/day, responses locked after 24 hours
- Pro plan: unlimited calls and full history access

### Semantic Search

Natural language search across all your AI function data:

- Search functions, execution logs, and errors
- Hybrid search (vector similarity + keyword filtering)
- RAG-powered Q&A for exploring your codebase

### Multi-Language UI

English, Japanese, and Korean UI out of the box — built for global teams.

## How It Works

VectorSurfer reads from the same Weaviate instance that VectorWave writes to. There is no extra instrumentation needed — just use `@vectorize` in your Python code, and VectorSurfer shows everything.

VectorWave is not required to use VectorSurfer, but the SDK is what generates the data the dashboard displays.
