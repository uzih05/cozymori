## Welcome to cozymori

cozymori is an organization building open-source AI observability tools. Our mission is to make monitoring, caching, and healing AI functions feel intuitive and — dare we say — cozy.

## Ecosystem

### VectorWave

A decorator-based Python framework that vectorizes function calls and stores them in Weaviate. VectorWave provides semantic caching, self-healing, distributed tracing, and drift detection for AI/LLM applications.

```bash
pip install vectorwave
```

**Key features:**
- `@vectorize` decorator for tracing and caching any function
- Semantic caching — similar inputs return cached results instantly
- Self-healing — AI analyzes errors, generates fixes, opens GitHub PRs
- Distributed tracing with trace_id/span_id hierarchy
- Semantic drift detection with webhook alerts
- RAG-powered code Q&A over your codebase
- Rust-accelerated batch writing via PyO3

### VectorSurfer

A full-stack observability dashboard for VectorWave. Built with Next.js 16 + FastAPI, VectorSurfer provides real-time monitoring, trace visualization, AI-powered error diagnosis, and replay testing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cozymori/VectorSurfer
cd VectorSurfer && npm run dev
```

**Key features:**
- Bento grid dashboard with drag-and-drop widgets
- Distributed trace waterfall visualization
- AI Healer — GPT-4 powered error diagnosis (single and batch)
- Replay testing with exact match and semantic comparison
- Hybrid semantic search + RAG Q&A
- Multi-language UI (English, Japanese, Korean)

### VectorSurferSTL

A lightweight Streamlit-based alternative to VectorSurfer. Same core monitoring features in a single-process Python app — ideal for quick setups and local development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cozymori/VectorSurferSTL
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### VectorCheck

A CLI regression testing framework for AI/LLM applications. Traditional `assert a == b` fails for generative AI — VectorCheck uses vector similarity and LLM judge evaluation instead.

```bash
pip install vectorcheck

# Run regression tests
vw test --target all --semantic --threshold 0.85
```

**Testing modes:**
- Exact match — compare outputs literally
- Vector similarity — compare via embedding cosine similarity
- LLM Judge — use GPT-4 to evaluate semantic equivalence

## Philosophy

- **Developer First** — APIs designed by developers, for developers
- **Zero Bloat** — One decorator does it all, no configuration bloat
- **Python Native** — Built for the Python AI ecosystem with Rust for performance
- **Open Source** — MIT licensed, community-driven

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 — 3.13
- Docker (for Weaviate vector database)
- OpenAI API key (for self-healing and RAG features)

## Next Steps

- Read the [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart) guide to get up and running
- Explore the [VectorWave](/vectorwave) and [VectorSurfer](/vectorsurf) product pages
