## What is VectorSurferSTL?

**VectorSurferSTL** is a lightweight, Python-only alternative to [VectorSurfer](/docs/vectorsurf-overview). Built with **Streamlit**, it provides core monitoring features with minimal setup — no frontend build step required.

| Feature | VectorSurfer | VectorSurferSTL |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Production, teams | Quick setup, local dev |
| **Setup time** | Dashboard ready | ~1 min |
| **AI Healer** | Full UI | Basic UI |
| **Multi-language** | EN/JA/KO | EN only |
| **Customization** | High | Moderate |

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install vectorsurferstl
```

```bash
vectorsurferstl
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **Weaviate** running with VectorWave data

If you already have Weaviate running for VectorWave, no additional database setup is needed.

## Features

### Dashboard
