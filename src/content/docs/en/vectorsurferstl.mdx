## What is VectorSurferSTL?

**VectorSurferSTL** is a lightweight, single-process alternative to [VectorSurfer](/docs/vectorsurf-overview). Built with **Streamlit**, it provides the same core monitoring features in a much simpler setup — no Node.js, no FastAPI, just Python.

| Feature | VectorSurfer | VectorSurferSTL |
|---|---|---|
| **Stack** | Next.js + FastAPI | Streamlit (Python only) |
| **Setup time** | ~5 min | ~1 min |
| **Best for** | Production, teams | Quick setup, local dev |
| **Dashboard** | Bento grid, drag-drop | Streamlit widgets |
| **AI Healer** | Full UI | Basic UI |
| **Multi-language** | EN/JA/KO | EN only |
| **Customization** | High (React components) | Moderate (Streamlit) |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cozymori/VectorSurferSTL
cd VectorSurferSTL
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **Docker** (for Weaviate)
- **Weaviate** running on `http://localhost:8080`

If you already have Weaviate running for VectorWave, no additional database setup is needed.

## Environment Setup

Create `.env` in the project root:

```bash
# Weaviate
WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# OpenAI (for AI Healer and search)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## Features

### Dashboard

- Function execution count and success rate
- Average latency metrics
- Cache hit rate
- Error count and recent errors

### Execution Browser

- List all tracked function executions
- Filter by function name, status, date range
- View execution details: inputs, outputs, errors
- Trace ID linking

### Search

- Search executions by keyword
- Filter by function, team, status

### AI Healer (Basic)

- Select an error to diagnose
- View AI-generated root cause analysis
- See suggested code fix

## When to Use VectorSurferSTL

**Choose VectorSurferSTL when:**
